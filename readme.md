# mYShop

Full fledge E-commerce fullstack project built using the popular MERN stack.

Almost gave up on it mid-way. Somehow I managed to pull myself together and have now deployed it to [Heroku](https://kashop.herokuapp.com/).

This was a huge undertaking without a doubt. Definitely the biggest project so far. Hence the development was even more painstaking of a task. But the final push to the remotes have been, as usual, satisfying.

**Closing Statement**: I'm tired and won't be working on projects of this magnitude for a few months.

## Todo:

- Proper stripe integration
  - Right now it's a rag tag integration
- Remove unnecessary requests to sever
  - Too many requests being thrown during simple page navigation: not good both for us and the users
